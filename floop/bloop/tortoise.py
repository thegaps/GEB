# Not bloop.
# 	There are plenty of numbers greater than N, I can even think of
# 	three off-the-cuff; N+7, N+37, N+101!
# Don't know how long we might have to wait until we get a good one. . .

# Tortoise property:
#	An even number, 2N, has the Tortoise property if it is the 
#	difference of two odd primes.

# Check if a given number, N, has the tortoise property
